# COARV-WebGL

A TypeScript and WebGL project for the COARV subject at Ã‰cole Centrale de Nantes

## Introduction

This project is the result of the tutorial "Create your own FPS in WebGL" from openclassrooms proposed as of the COARV subject. 
To learn something else, I configured an webpack project with typescript support and updated some parts of the tutorial code with an update usage of babylon.js.

## Getting started

### Built with

* [babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### Installation

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iagocaran/COARV-WebGL.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

The project has two targets:
* Build: that will output files in the dist/ directory
```sh
npm run build
```
* Dev: that will launch webpack's devServer
```sh
